### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub. I am a PhD student in learning-based control for multi-agent systems with a background in automation, robotics and control. Here you can find projects done during my university career, plus some side projects.

I am currently working at Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC), TU Delft.

You can find some of my projects under the shared profile @gbattocletti-riccardoUrb (https://github.com/gbattocletti-riccardoUrb).

Have fun and take care,

Gianpietro

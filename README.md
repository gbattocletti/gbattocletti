### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub. I am a Mechatronic Engineer with some background in automation, embedded systems and Artificial Intelligence. Here you can find some projects done during my university career, plus some side project I do with my friends.

At the moment, most of my projects are under the shared profile @gbattocletti-riccardoUrb (https://github.com/gbattocletti-riccardoUrb).

Have fun and take care,
Gianpietro

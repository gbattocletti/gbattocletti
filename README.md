### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub. I am a Mechatronic Engineer with some background in automation, embedded systems and Artificial Intelligence. Here you can find some projects done during my university career, plus some side project I do with my friends. I am _not_ a programmer, so the code you find here isn't probably the most beautiful you have ever seen. But, for sure, it works!

At the moment, most of my projects are under the shared profile @gbattocletti-riccardoUrb (https://github.com/gbattocletti-riccardoUrb).

Have fun and take care,

Gianpietro
